# intersight-reporting
This python script is used to collect data from Cisco Intersight. The focus was to gather information about all servers that use SD-Cards and Controllers and check if there's another storage controller available.

## Setup
There are some requirements:
1. Python on your machine
Install Python3 on your machine: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Intersight credentials
The easiest way is to create API Keys in Intersight: https://intersight.com/apidocs/introduction/security/ and save them as environment variables using the `export` command.

More information and the API explorer can be found here: https://intersight.com/apidocs/apirefs/aaa/AuditRecords/model/
